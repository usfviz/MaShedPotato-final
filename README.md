### Shivakanth Thudi (sthudi@usfca.edu) & Matthew Wang (wwang69@usfca.edu)
### Final Project for Data Visualization (MSAN 622)



# Introduction

We used d3.js for making different visualizations of flights data from the Bureau of Transporation. We used data on domestic flights from 2016 for making the following plots:

- [Chord Diagram](https://shivathudi.github.io/flights-chord/)
  - Shows the frequency of flights between the top 30 domestic airports in the US. Smaller airports are grouped into the "Other Cities" category.

- [Bubble Map](https://wenmwang.github.io/flight-visualizer/)
  - Shows how busy airports are across the US. The size of the bubbles encodes the number of flights that are outbound from a certain airport. Also shows major hubs of different flight carriers in the US.
 
- [Delay Choropleth](https://shivathudi.github.io/flights-choropleth/)
  - Shows the percentage of flights delayed from states across the US. The color red encodes this percentage, with deeper shades signifying higher percentages of flights delayed

- [Parallel Coordinates](https://shivathudi.github.io/flights-parcoord/)
  - Shows multidimensional relationships across carriers - such as the number of flights, the distance in miles, air time in minutes, arrival and departure delays in minutes, etc.
